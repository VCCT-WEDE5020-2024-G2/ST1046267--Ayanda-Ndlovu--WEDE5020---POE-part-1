        Welcome to Kitara, a compassionate animal welfare organization dedicated
        to protecting, nurturing, and rehoming animals in need. Kitara was founded
        in [2003] by [Jack Foreman], driven by a shared passion for animal
        welfare. Our journey began with
        Jack,Ayanda,France, Ryan, Lily,Francina,Stijn,Daan and Loek when they realised
        how animals were being treated and there was no one who would stand up for
        them .Today, we operate a state-of-the-art shelter, provide comprehensive
        veterinary care, and engage with the community through education and
        outreach programs. Kitara's mission is to provide safe haven, medical
        care, and loving support to abandoned, injured, and vulnerable animals. We
        strive to create lifelong connections between humans and animals through
        adoption, education, and community engagement.
